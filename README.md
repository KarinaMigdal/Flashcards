### Flashcards

Traditional flashcards are small note cards used for testing 
and   improving   memory   through   practiced  information
retrieval.  The `Flashcards` app is a great alternative for
people who want to have their flashcards always at hand. In 
`Flashcards`  app you can make your own folders,  give them 
a  category  name  and  complete it with flashcards.  Done? 
Enter  Game  Mode to start learning.  Remember - regularity 
matters.
